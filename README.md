# TestPathError

Showcase for an `E_FAIL` `COMException` caused by a specific `PathGeometry`<>.

Issue: [dotnet/maui#24685](https://github.com/dotnet/maui/issues/24685)

The project `MauiPathError` is a sample project that causes the `COMException`.

The project `WinUiPathSuccess` shows that the same `PathGeometry` works in a WinUI project.
